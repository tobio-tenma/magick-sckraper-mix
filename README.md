# Magick Skraper Mix

## A re-implementation of [garlic-onion-skraper-mix](https://github.com/ebzero/garlic-onion-skraper-mix) in pure ImageMagick!

Recreated the fantastic [Mix](https://github.com/ebzero/garlic-onion-skraper-mix) for [Skraper](https://www.skraper.net/) created by [EBZero](https://github.com/ebzero) so that it could be called from the command line. This opens up the possibility to generate the media straight from your device. Perfect for when you augment your collection with a few games and don't want to configure and set up Skraper.

### Sample of Script Output

Below is a comparison between the two scraped media generation methods:

| Generated with Skraper                | Generated with ImageMagick            |
|:-------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------:|
|![Generated Using Skraper](images/generated-using-skraper.png "Generated Using Skraper")|![Generated with ImageMagick](images/generated-using-imagemagick.png "Generated with ImageMagick")

### Running the Script

1. Open a terminal window to the location of this project and execute the following: `./magick-skraper-mix.ps1`
2. Observe the newly created file `final_output.png`.

The `images` directory contains the source images for the sample output created by the script and the `.work-temp` is fairly self explanatory. 

Note: Low resolution images were used for the results generated by this script. This will be addressed and updated when time permits.

### Acknowledgements

Thanks to [EBZero](https://github.com/ebzero) for creating the original mix to which script this is replicating. Thanks to the awesome [Skraper](https://skraper.net) developer(s) for the fantastic tool along with the hard working folks over at [Screenscraper.fr](https://screenscraper.fr) for providing the media to scraper! It's worth considering a donation to one or any of these great projects. Thanks also to the developers behind the fanstic tool [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/) to which none of this would be possible without!
