# Magick Skraper Mix

## A re-implementation of [garlic-onion-skraper-mix](https://github.com/ebzero/garlic-onion-skraper-mix) in pure ImageMagick!

Recreated the fantastic [Mix](https://github.com/ebzero/garlic-onion-skraper-mix) for [Skraper](https://www.skraper.net/) created by [ebzero](https://github.com/ebzero) so that it could be called from the command line. This opens up the possibility to generate the media straght from your device. Perfect for when you augment your collection with a few games.

### Sample

Below is a comparison betwen the two scraped media generation methods:

Note: Low resolution images were used for the results produced above. Will update the image with a better one soon.
